## Features

### Resources
From 2.14 version onwards there is a new functionality helping to send a full 3d context maps for the further use in CAD, BIM or any 3D software. This can be applied by clicking "Apply transformations on Send" before sending the data. 
![transforms_intro](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-qgis/assets/89912278/450b4c21-bb6e-4526-8d7b-2e8d3a96eb92)

At the moment, 4 types of transformations are available: 

- **Creating a mesh from Digital Elevation Model:** converting a sigle-band raster layer to a 3d mesh. 
- **Using a raster layer as a texture for a 3d mesh:** mapping the raster image onto a 3d elevation (requires pre-selected Elevation layer). 
- **Extruding polygons:** using a random value or a numeric/text attribute field of the layer. 
- **Projecting polygons onto 3d elevation:** move the lowest point of the polygon to the lowest point of the surrounding terrain (requires pre-selected Elevation layer).

Additionally: 
- **Setting a layer as Elevation layer:** will be used as a base for several transformations, such as texturing and projecting on a terrain.

You can add and remove transformations using + and - buttons above and under the list with applied transformations: 
![transforms_add](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-qgis/assets/89912278/8f6e9894-15c6-4ea8-bf16-5da0df276076)


Each transformations type is targeting a specific layer type, e.g. only polygon layers or only raster layers. Extrusion transformation will offer additional parameter - choice of the attribute to use for the extrusion value. If you choose the option "populate NULL values", you will be able to set a "Random height" as a value.

Add "Log Messages Panel" to your QGIS interface to see more info and warnings about your transformations.
